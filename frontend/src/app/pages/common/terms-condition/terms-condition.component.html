              <li><h5>Services</h5></li>
              <p>
                Afiliyo Networks LLP. (“Afiliyo”) provides and operates online
                websites at https://www.afiliyo.com (the “Sites”) and operates
                various applications, such as Afiliyo (the “Apps”) (collectively
                the “Services”). People use our Services to shop their favourite
                Influencers from suggested content. Our Services allow Users/
                Members to register, post pictures or videos, find, follow, and
                shop influencer content (individuals and entities with websites,
                blogs, social media presence, agents or agencies, digital
                publishers and other content platforms) on the Platform (“Users/
                Members “) and therefore “Users/ Members “ can create an account
                with us (“Account“) to earn commission on tracked purchases from
                Unique links posted on our Platform/ App “Afiliyo” & shared by
                Users/Members on their personal networks from retailers on the
                Platform (“Retailers“). To qualify for commission, the Retailer
                must confirm that the User’s/ Member’s purchase through the
                customized link is tracked, genuine and successful (constituting
                a “Qualifying Transaction “). Members can also share these
                customized Afiliyo links with their friends, family and so on.
                When any Qualifying Transactions are generated through these
                links and Afiliyo receives commission fee for these Qualifying
                Transactions from Retailers, Afiliyo will pay Users/ Members
                “Commission” for sales generated via their customized Afiliyo
                links. Please note that if for any reason whatsoever, Afiliyo
                does not get paid commission from Retailers for Qualifying
                Transactions, then no Profit is due to the Member as well. In
                the event that the Retailers do not track a transaction using
                their affiliate tracking system, then such sales might not be
                paid to Afiliyo, and hence any due or expected commission from
                these sales will also not be paid to the Member. We may also
                provide emails of content and Influencers that may interest you.
                Our Services create technological and commercial relationships
                between third-party retailers, advertisers and other businesses
                (“Retailers”), individuals and entities with websites, blogs,
                social media presence, agents or agencies, digital publishers
                and other content platforms (“Influencers”) and consumers
                (“You”, “Your” and “Users”). Our Services create a free, fun and
                convenient shopping experience to You, while facilitating sales
                and marketing of Merchant products and services (collectively,
                “Products”) and the payment of commissions to Influencers.

                  Afiliyo Parties shall not have any liability for any failure
                  to perform obligations under this Agreement if such failure is
                  caused by fire, flood, natural disaster, epidemic, act of God,
                  strike, civil unrest, riot, insurrection, revolution, war,
                  terrorism, lack or failure of suppliers or transportation
                  facilities, failure of utilities or telecommunications,
                  failure of third party software, law or governmental
                  regulation or other cause or event which is of a magnitude or
                  a type beyond the reasonable control of Afiliyo Parties or
                  such other party.

                <li><h5>Waiver / Severability / Headings.</h5></li>
                <p>
                  If any provision of the Agreement is found to be invalid,
                  illegal, or unenforceable, the validity, legality, and
                  enforceability of any of the remaining provisions will not in
                  any way be affected or impaired and a valid, legal, and
                  enforceable provision of similar intent and economic impact
                  will be substituted therefore. Afiliyo’ s failure to require
                  or enforce strict performance of any provision or to exercise
                  any right under the Agreement shall not be construed as a
                  waiver of any such provision or right. The headings appearing
                  at the beginning of each section are for identification and
                  reference purposes only and shall not be used to determine the
                  construction or interpretation of the Agreement.
