                customized link is tracked, genuine and successful (constituting
                a <b> “Qualifying Transaction </b>“). Members can also share

                links and Afiliyo receives commission fee for these Qualifying
                Transactions from Retailers, Afiliyo will pay Users/ Members
                “Commission” for sales generated via their customized Afiliyo
                links. Please note that if for any reason whatsoever, Afiliyo
                does not get paid commission from Retailers for Qualifying
                Transactions, then no Profit is due to the Member as well. In
                the event that the Retailers do not track a transaction using
                their affiliate tracking system, then such sales might not be
                paid to Afiliyo, and hence any due or expected commission from
                these sales will also not be paid to the Member.

            <li>
              To protect your privacy and security, we take reasonable steps
              (such as requesting a unique password) to verify your identity
              before creating your account. The user who created the account is
              responsible for maintaining the secrecy of their unique password
              and account information at all times. We use what we believe to be
              appropriate procedures to protect information against unauthorized
              access and disclosure. However, information you elect to post on
              our Services, emails and other information you send to us are not
              encrypted and such transmissions cannot be considered a secure
              means of transmitting sensitive information.

            <li>
              You should be aware of the limitations of security,
              authentication, encryption, and privacy measures used in
              connection with the Internet and that any information you transmit
              through the Services may be damaged, corrupted, "sniffed" and/or
              accessed by another person without your permission. Regardless of
              the precautions taken by you or by us, "perfect security" does not
              exist on the Internet. Third parties may unlawfully intercept or
              access transmissions or private communications, and other users
              may abuse or misuse your personal information that they collect
              from the Services. Therefore, although we work very hard to
              protect your privacy, we do not promise, and you should not
              expect, that your personal information or private communications
              will always remain private. We cannot ensure or warrant the
              ultimate security of any information you transmit.
